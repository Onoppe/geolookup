GeoLookup


Objective-C/Cocoa interface to the http://geonames.org reverse geocaching
web-service. It supports all geonames API commands requiring latitude and
longitude input. As such, GeoLookup is ideal for applications using
CoreLocation on iPhone, or equivalent desktop framework.

Test Cocoa application provided for implementation example. 

The core classes currently do not compile into a Framework. No external 
libraries or frameworks are required for GeoLookup, include the source files
in your own project to make use of the interface.


Requires OS X 10.5+ / Objective-C 2.0
